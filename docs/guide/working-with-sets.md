# Working with `Set<T>`

With the intention of being idiomatic, ts-dax's API returns a [`Set<T>`][set] instead of an [`Array<T>`][array] where possible (and suitable).

## Converting arrays to sets

Arrays can be easily converted to sets by supplying them to the `Set` constructor:

```ts
const arr = [...] // Your array object
const set = new Set(arr)
```

## Converting sets to arrays

Using [`Array.from()`][array.from], you
can easily create a `Set<T>` from a provided `Array<T>`.

```ts
const set = ... // Your set object (possibly generated by ts-dax)
const arr = Array.from(set)
```
